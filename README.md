# Data Analysis on Photo Likes

This small project was to try out the Facebook Graph Api. I took available data from my friends, and compared the date they posted the photo
and how many likes they got. Will possibly add onto it later, once an more interesting question poses in my minds.

## If you want to use
Download the repository and make sure you have pandas, matplotlib, and iso8601 (A time data type that facebook uses). You will have to make a
facebook developer account, and create access tokens, and create your own requests.
